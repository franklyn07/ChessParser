# ChessParser

In this project, a parser which is able to take a csv file containing a list of commands was created. 
This list of commands would be composed of a set of instructions a player would give to his corresponding chess pieces.
The objective of the parser is that of evaluating the correctness of the given commands (adhering to basic chess rules),
and monitor the performance of both the black and white players. At the end of the game, a report showing the statistics
of the game outcome (derived from the list of commands) is printed.

This was built making use of the 4 basic OOP principles as well as multiple design patters.
